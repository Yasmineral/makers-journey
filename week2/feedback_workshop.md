**What is feedback?**

Information about reactions to a product, a persons performance of a task, or behaviour, which is used as a basis for improvement. 

Humans need: Love, significance (value in the eyes of others), certainty, variety, growth, contribution
(Needs of the ego & spirit)

How do we make feedback easier? Build resilience. 

1. **Shift your perspective** - There is no positive or negative feedback. Only feedback. Only information. Make that cognitive shift that it’s all there to help you learn & grow. It’s a gift.
2. **Empowered receiver** - Actively solicit feedback. Be willing to look at yourself. It’s refreshing for others to have this attitude. Remember you’re the gate keeper - you can choose whether to take the feedback or not. Weigh it carefully. It's basically free therapy, helps to illuminate your triggers so you know what work to do to improve. Lean into it. Learn to practice assertiveness. 
3. **Know thyself** - We have 3 feedback triggers:
    * truth triggers (when truth seems wrong or off target)
    * relationship triggers (specific people triggering the same response in you)
    * Identity triggers (undermines how we see ourselves. We have blind spots. We can’t always see what others see. Only change the things that serve you and will help you be happier as they will have a positive effect on everything.
    * We build resilience by understanding ourselves. We can self regulate better.
    * What’s your happiness set point? (Take the Oxford happiness questionnaire). Meditation increases happiness.
    * Recovery & sustain. How long does it take for you to return to your baseline happiness?
4. **Understand feedback** - Appreciation (thank, acknowledge, connect, motivate), Evaluation (rate against a set of standards), Coaching( improve performance). We need all 3. There is no positive or negative feedback. 
5. **Use a framework** -ASK - **Actionable**, **Specific**, **Kind**. Avoid vague adjectives. Give people data to work with so they can come up with steps to change response to the feedback. Avoid triggering defenses. Avoid making assumptions.  

Ask yourself & peers at Makers - what’s one thing I’m doing well? One thing I can improve on? Get into the habit of doing this often.
Communication stance, illuminate situation - be non judgmental and compassionate.

**Non-Violent communication**

Observation - facts, not stories
Feeling - ‘this behaviour has this effect on me’. Stay neutral.
Needs - your responsibility to coordinate them
Request - ‘Help me help us’. ‘Would you like…?
