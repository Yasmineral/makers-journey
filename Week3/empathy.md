# Empathy workshop

**What is empathy?**

The ability to sense other peoples emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking or feeling. 

Reading recommendation - The 5 dysfunctions of a team.

The 3 types of empathy - affective empathy(feeling emotionally with someone else but not driven to help in a certain way), empathetic concern (consciously understanding and internalising the emotions of another person, driven to help or respond appropriately), cognitive empathy (consciously imagining how someone is feeling without internalising).

Reasons why emptahy may be missing:
* Anger- feeling contempt for someone, judging them
* Protection - feeling as though another pain is like a ‘virus’
* Identifying - try to rationalise/talk them out/ ‘fix’ their feelings instead of being there with them. Brings up your own issues.
* Fear of intimacy - risk of venerability
* Overwhelmed - have too much of your own stuff on

Empathy without boundaries is not empathy.

Training the skill:
1. **Just like ‘me’** - Tribal. Create bigger similarities with people. ‘Just like me…this person is seeking happiness in their life” See connection rather than separation. 
2. **Metta Bhavna** - loving kindness meditation, check out Youtube). Pay attention to kindness and compassion
3. **Empathetic listening** - Giving someone the gift of your full attention. Stop toxic assumptions. 80 / 20 listening. Hold a space. Pretend you’ll have to write a test about the person.
