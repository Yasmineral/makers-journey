# Unit Testing
Unit tests are the code you write to test your code. They provide you with reassuarance that everything works as it should, and help to guard against introducing future errors. Just as a chef needs to test the food they make to be sure itâ€™s good enough to serve to their guests, you need to write unit tests in order to ensure that your code is of high quality.

At a high level, unit testing is about testing individual methods or areas (units) of your code to ensure that they do what you expect them to do. For any given unit of code, your unit tests allow you to ensure that, given a certain set of inputs, the output is as you expect.
