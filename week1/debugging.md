# Advice from past cohorts

* Work on problem-solving methodology asap
* Try putting an hour aside when home to learn something more in-depth. ‘hour of power’
* Don’t get wasted at weekends, this is only 3 months, don’t waste it
* Start documenting learnings and working on a thesis
* Measure your success using things that you have learnt as opposed to the amount of work that you have completed 
* Get comfortable with not finishing anything and take what learning you can from each challenge
* Understanding the difference between what to test and what not to test. TDD is important, and can really help get the ball rolling when tackling your first couple of assignments
* Message coaches for help when blocked
* Aim to do a professional review half way through the course

# Week 1 goals
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
  * RSpec / objects and methods / TDD process
